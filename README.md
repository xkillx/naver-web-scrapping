# Scalable Web Scraping Infrastructure for High-Volume Data Extraction

## Objectives

- **Scrape** 2 million URLs per day.
- **Ensure reliability** by handling dynamic content, CAPTCHA challenges, and IP bans.
- **Optimize performance** for minimal latency and efficient resource usage.

---

## Key Components of the System

### 1. **Proxy Management**
- Use **rotating proxies** to avoid IP bans.
- Integrate a **proxy pool service** like Bright Data, Oxylabs, or SmartProxy.
- Implement a **retry mechanism** for failed requests due to proxy issues.
  
#### Implementation Steps:
1. Configure the scraper to rotate proxies dynamically.
2. Monitor proxy health to replace failing proxies.
3. Use region-specific proxies for localized content (e.g., Taiwan for Shopee).

---

### 2. **Task Queue System**
- Use a **distributed task queue** such as **RabbitMQ** or **Celery** to manage scraping tasks.
- Prioritize tasks to handle high-value pages first.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Split URLs into batches for parallel processing.
2. Monitor queue performance to dynamically scale workers.

---

### 3. **Concurrency Management**
- Use an **asynchronous framework** like **Pythonâ€™s asyncio** or **Node.js**.
- Implement concurrency limits to balance speed and avoid server detection.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Utilize libraries such as **aiohttp** or **Scrapy** for concurrent requests.
2. Configure rate limits based on server response.

---

### 4. **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure**
- Deploy scraping jobs on a **cloud platform** such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- Use **Kubernetes** or **Docker Swarm** for container orchestration.

#### Key Tools:
- **EC2 or GCP Compute Engine**: Scalable virtual machines.
- **EKS or GKE**: Managed Kubernetes for auto-scaling worker nodes.

---

### 5. **Data Storage**
- Use a high-throughput database for storing scraped data:
  - **Relational DB**: PostgreSQL for structured data.
  - **NoSQL DB**: MongoDB for flexible schemas.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Design a schema for the data to ensure easy querying.
2. Use batch inserts for improved database performance.

---

### 6. **Error Handling and Monitoring**
- Implement robust error handling for failed requests and retries.
- Set up monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Log request status and response times.
2. Configure alerts for proxy issues or high failure rates.

---

### 7. **Dynamic Content Handling**
- Use **headless browsers** like Puppeteer or Playwright for JavaScript-heavy pages.
- Cache frequently accessed resources to reduce processing time.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Identify dynamic content patterns during initial analysis.
2. Deploy headless browsers only for URLs that require them.

Below is a high-level architecture for the system:

```
+------------------+
| URL Input Queue  |
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+        +-------------------+
|  Worker Nodes    +-----> | Proxy Pool Service |
|  (Scrapers)      |        +-------------------+
+--------+---------+
         |
         v

|  Data Storage    +<----- | Monitoring System  |
|  (DB/Cloud)      |        +-------------------+
+------------------+
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Proxy Costs**:
   - Opt for a pay-as-you-go proxy plan for initial runs.
   - Analyze request success rate to reduce redundant proxies.
2. **Infrastructure Costs**:
   - Use spot instances on cloud platforms for cost-effective VM scaling.
   - Optimize scraper code to reduce the need for headless browsers.

## Challenges and Solutions

| **Challenge**         | **Solution**                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| IP Bans               | Rotating proxies, adaptive retry mechanism.              |
| Dynamic Content        | Use headless browsers sparingly for JavaScript-heavy pages. |
| High Failure Rates     | Retry logic, real-time monitoring, and alerts.           |
| Data Consistency       | Design robust database schemas and periodic audits.      |

## Scaling to 2 Million URLs/Day

1. **Concurrency**:
   - Run 1,000 workers scraping ~2,000 URLs per worker daily.
   - Use asynchronous requests to increase efficiency.

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Estimate bandwidth and CPU requirements based on test results.
   - Scale cloud resources dynamically using auto-scaling groups.

3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Minimize retries by analyzing failed requests.
   - Optimize request headers and timeouts for specific targets.

---

## Conclusion

By implementing the above strategies, the infrastructure will be scalable, cost-effective, and resilient. This ensures high performance and reliability for scraping up to 2 million URLs per day.
